# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! 👋  
I am currently focused on working in the field of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. This repository serves as a showcase for my projects, research, and explorations in these domains.

## 🔍 About Me
I am passionate about data-driven solutions, and I am continuously learning and applying new techniques in **Machine Learning**, **Data Analysis**, and **Artificial Intelligence** to solve real-world problems. My **aim** is to:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights from data using statistical and visual methods.
- **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**: Building models for classification, regression, clustering, etc.
- **Model Evaluation & Optimization**: Tuning hyperparameters, cross-validation, and improving model performance.
- **Deep Learning**: Working with neural networks for image classification, NLP, etc.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Extracting insights from text and building models for text classification.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Some of the key tools and libraries I am working with include:

- **Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: 
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for data visualization
  - `Scikit-learn` for machine learning models
  - `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `PyTorch` for deep learning
  - `NLTK`, `SpaCy` for NLP tasks
- **Databases**: SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub


> **Note**: This repository is continuously updated with my latest work, so stay tuned!
